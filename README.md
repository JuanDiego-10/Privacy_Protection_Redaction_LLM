## Introduction

In today's digital age, data privacy is more important than ever. The **Privacy Protection Redaction LLM** aims to provide a robust solution for redacting personally identifiable information (PII) from various text sources. By using state-of-the-art transformer models, we can automate the process of identifying and removing sensitive information, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Redaction**: Utilizes deep learning models to identify and redact PII.
- **Flexible Integration**: Easily integrate with existing workflows and applications.
- **Customizable Models**: Fine-tune models based on specific use cases.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Jupyter Notebooks for easy experimentation.
- **Open Source**: Free to use and modify according to your needs.

## Technologies Used

This project incorporates several cutting-edge technologies:

- **AI**: Artificial Intelligence for intelligent data processing.
- **CUDA**: For accelerated computations on NVIDIA GPUs.
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizing neural networks for complex data analysis.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: A library for state-of-the-art NLP models.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for data science.
- **PyTorch**: A flexible deep learning framework.
- **NLP**: Natural Language Processing techniques for text analysis.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JuanDiego-10/Privacy_Protection_Redaction_LLM.git
cd Privacy_Protection_Redaction_LLM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You will also need to have CUDA set up if you plan to use GPU acceleration.

## Usage

Once you have installed the repository, you can start using it in your Jupyter Notebook. Here's a basic example of how to use the redaction functionality:

```python
from redaction_model import Redactor

# Initialize the redactor
redactor = Redactor()

# Sample text containing PII
text = "My name is John Doe and my email is john.doe@example.com."

# Perform redaction
redacted_text = redactor.redact(text)

print(redacted_text)
```

This will output the text with sensitive information redacted.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Redaction

You can start with simple text inputs to see how the model performs:

```python
text = "Contact me at jane.smith@gmail.com."
redacted_text = redactor.redact(text)
print(redacted_text)  # Output: "Contact me at [REDACTED]."
```

### Example 2: Batch Processing

The model can also handle multiple texts at once:

```python
texts = [
    "My phone number is 123-456-7890.",
    "My address is 123 Main St, Springfield."
]
redacted_texts = redactor.redact_batch(texts)
print(redacted_texts)  # Outputs redacted texts for each input.
```
